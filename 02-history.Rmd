# APSIM-Wheat history {#history}

APSIM-Wheat has been developed from a combination of the approaches
used in previous APSIM wheat modules: 
@assengPerformanceAPSIMwheatModel1998; @assengUseAPSIMWheat1998; @keatingOverviewAPSIMModel2003; @meinkeImprovingWheatSimulation1997; @meinkeImprovingWheatSimulation1998.
The current version of the model is implemented within the APSIM Plant
model framework which is currently used for other crops such as grain
legumes and canola. Most of the model constants (species-specific)
and parameters (cultivar specific) are externalized from the code
(wheat.xml file).
