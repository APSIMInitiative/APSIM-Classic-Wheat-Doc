"],["scope.html", "1 Scope of the APSIM-Wheat module", " 1 Scope of the APSIM-Wheat module The APSIM-Wheat module simulates the wheat growth and development of a wheat crop in a daily time-step on an area basis (per square meter, not per single plant). In this module, the wheat crop Wheat growth and development responds to weather (radiation, temperature), soil water and soil nitrogen, and management practices. The wheat module returns information on its soil water and nitrogen uptake to the soil water and nitrogen modules on a daily basis for reset of these systems. Information on crop cover is also provided to the water balance module for calculation of evaporation rates and runoff. Wheat stover and root residues are ‘passed’ from wheat to the surface residue and soil nitrogen modules, respectively at the harvest of the wheat crop. The approaches used in modeling crop processes balance the need for a comprehensive description of the observed variation in crop performance over diverse production environments and the need to avoid reductionist approaches of ever-greater complexity with large numbers of parameters that are difficult to measure. A list of the module outputs is provided in the Wheat module output s section below. Basically the module simulates phenological development, leaf area growth expansion, biomass and N concentration of different crop components (Leaf, Stem, Root and Grain) on a daily basis. It also predicts grain size and grain number. "],["history.html", "2 APSIM-Wheat history", " 2 APSIM-Wheat history APSIM-Wheat has been developed from a combination of the approaches used in previous APSIM wheat modules: Asseng, Keating, et al. (1998); Asseng, Fillery, et al. (1998); Keating et al. (2003); Meinke et al. (1997); Meinke et al. (1998). The current version of the model is implemented within the APSIM Plant model framework which is currently used for other crops such as grain legumes and canola. Most of the model constants (species-specific) and parameters (cultivar specific) are externalized from the code (wheat.xml file). Reference "],["phenology.html", "3 Phenology 3.1 Thermal time calculation 3.2 Sowing-germination phase 3.3 Germination-emergence phase 3.4 Photoperiod impact on phenology 3.5 Vernalisation impact on phenology", " 3 Phenology There are 11 phases in APSIM-Wheat module (Fig. 3.1). The timing of each phase (except from sowing to germination, which is driven by sowing depth and thermal time) is determined by the accumulation of thermal time (\\(TT\\)) adjusted for other factors which vary with the phase considered (e.g. vernalisation, photoperiod, N). The length of each phase is determined by a fixed thermal time (thermal time target), which is specified by tt_&lt; phase_name&gt; in wheat.xml. Most parameters of thermal time targets are cultivar-specific. 3.1 Thermal time calculation The daily thermal time (\\(\\Delta TT\\)) is calculated from the daily average of maximum and minimum crown temperatures, and is adjusted by genetic and environmental factors. Hence, the duration of phases between emergence and floral initiation is adjusted for photoperiod and vernalisation, using the cultivar-specific parameters photoperiod factor (\\(f_{D}\\), Equation (3.7)) and vernalisation factor (\\(f_{V}\\), Equation (3.8)). Other environmental factors include soil water stress (\\(f_{W,\\,pheno}\\), Equation (11.7)), nitrogen stress (\\(f_{N,\\,pheno}\\), Equation (12.3)) and phosphorus stress (\\(f_{P,\\,pheno}\\), Section (???)(Phosphorus-stress)) in all phases except from Sowing to Emergence (See details below), but they are all parametrized to have to effect in the current released APSIM-Wheat. All factors are bound from 0 to 1. Figure 3.1: Phenology in the APSIM_Wheat module. Targets are expressed in adjusted thermal time and are cultivar-specific parameters. The values given for the reference genotype Hartog. Crown temperatures are simulated according to the original routines in CERES-Wheat and correspond to air temperatures for non-freezing temperatures. The maximum and minimum crown temperatures (\\(T_{cmax}\\) and \\(T_{cmin}\\)) are calculated according to the maximum and minimum air temperature (\\(T_{max}\\) and \\(T_{min}\\)), respectively. \\[\\begin{equation} T_{cmax}=\\begin{cases} 2+T_{max}(0.4+0.0018(H_{snow}-15)^{2}) &amp; \\quad T_{max}&lt;0\\\\ T_{max} &amp; \\quad T_{max}\\geq0 \\end{cases} \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} T_{cmin}=\\begin{cases} 2+T_{min}(0.4+0.0018(H_{snow}-15)^{2}) &amp; \\quad T_{min}&lt;0\\\\ T_{min} &amp; \\quad T_{min}\\geq0 \\end{cases} \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(H_{snow}\\) is the snow depth (cm). The default value of \\(H_{snow}\\) is set to zero in the source codes (Fig. 3.2). For more detail information about Equation (3.1) and Equation (3.2), please see the function in the APSIM code. Figure 3.2: Crown temperature (\\(T_{c}\\)) in response to air temperature (\\(T\\)) for different snow depth (\\(H_{snow}\\)) in APSIM-Wheat. In the released APSIM version, \\(H_{snow}\\) equals zero cm. The daily crown mean temperature (\\(T_{c}\\)) is calculated by the maximum (\\(T_{cmax}\\)) and minimum (\\(T_{cmin}\\)) crown temperature. \\[\\begin{equation} T_{c}=\\frac{T_{cmax}+T_{cmin}}{2} \\end{equation}\\] Daily thermal time (\\(\\Delta TT\\)) is calculated based on daily mean crown temperature, using three cardinal temperatures (Fig. 3.3). The default values of the cardinal temperatures and relative thermal time are specified by x_temp (0, 26, 34) and y_tt (0, 26, 0), respectively, in the wheat.xml (Fig. 3.3). Other crop modules in APSIM calculate thermal time every 3 hours. \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta TT=\\begin{cases} T_{c} &amp; \\quad0&lt;T_{c}\\leq26\\\\ \\frac{26}{8}(34-T_{c}) &amp; \\quad26&lt;T_{c}\\leq34\\\\ 0 &amp; \\quad T_{c}\\leq0\\;\\text{or}\\;T_{c}&gt;34 \\end{cases} \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] Figure 3.3: Daily thermal time (\\(\\Delta TT\\)) in response to daily crown temperature (\\(T_{c}\\)) in APSIM-Wheat. For each phenological stage, the daily thermal time (\\(TT^{\\prime}\\)) is summed from the start of phase and can be reduced by photoperiod (\\(f_{D}\\), Equation (3.7)) and vernalisation factor (\\(f_{V}\\), Equation (3.8)) and also dependent on environmental factors (photoperiod and temperature). The environmental factors include soil water stress (\\(f_{W,\\,pheno}\\), Equation (11.7)), nitrogen stress (\\(f_{N,\\,pheno}\\), Equation (12.3)) and phosphorus stress (\\(f_{P,\\,pheno}\\), Section (???)(Phosphorus-stress)). The next phenological stage occurs when this adjusted thermal time (\\(TT^{\\prime}\\) in Equation (3.4)) reaches the target thermal time for the stage considered Fig. 3.1. \\[\\begin{equation} TT^{\\prime}=\\sum[\\Delta TT\\times\\min(f_{D},\\;f_{V})\\times\\min(f_{W,\\,pheno},\\:f_{N,\\,pheno},\\;f_{P,\\,pheno})] \\tag{3.4} \\end{equation}\\] In the current released version, soil water, nitrogen and phosphorus stresses have no effect on phenological development (i.e. parameters \\(f_{W,\\,pheno}=f_{P,\\,pheno}=1\\) Equation (11.7), and \\(f_{N,\\,pheno}\\) has values typically above 1 Equation (12.3)). So, Equation (3.4) is reduced to \\[\\begin{equation} TT^{\\prime}=\\sum[\\Delta TT\\times\\min(f_{D},\\;f_{V})] \\tag{3.5} \\end{equation}\\] In the output variables of wheat module, \\(TT^{\\prime}\\) from the start of each phase is named as ttafter&lt; phasename&gt;. For example, the output variable ttaftersowing is not the actual thermal time after sowing, but the thermal time adjusted for genetic and environmental factors. 3.2 Sowing-germination phase The seed germination is determined by soil water availability in the seeded layer (specified by pesw_germ with default value 0 mm). The crop will die if germination has not occurred before a certain period, defined by days_germ_limit in wheat.xml, which has a default value of 40 d. 3.3 Germination-emergence phase The germination to emergence phase includes an effect of the depth of sowing (\\(D_{seed}\\)) on the thermal time target. The phase is comprised of an initial period of fixed thermal time during which shoot elongation is slow (the lag phase, \\(T_{lag}\\)) and a linear period, where the rate of shoot elongation (\\(r_{e}\\), C d mm\\(^{-1}\\)) towards the soil surface is linearly related to air temperature. Then, the period of emergence (\\(T_{emer}\\)) is calculated by \\[\\begin{equation} T_{emer}=T_{lag}+r_{e}D_{seed} \\tag{3.6} \\end{equation}\\] The crop will die if emergence has not occurred before a certain period, defined by tt_emerg_limit in wheat.xml, which has a default value of 300\\(^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\) d. Most studies on seedling germination have simply recorded the accumulated thermal time between germination and 50% emergence from a given sowing depth. For the purposes of model parametrization the value of \\(T_{lag}\\) (shoot_lag) has been assumed to be around 40 \\(^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\) d, while \\(r_{e}\\) (shoot_rate) has been derived from studies where thermal time to emergence was measured and where sowing depth was known and it is set to 1.5 \\(^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\) d per mm. This means that at a sowing depth of 40 mm emergence occurs 100\\(^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\) d after germination (\\(40+1.5\\times40\\)). There is the capability of increasing the time taken to reach emergence due to a dry soil layer in which the seed is germinating, through the relationship between fasw_emerg and rel_emerg_rate. Currently this effect is turned off in the Wheat.xml file. 3.4 Photoperiod impact on phenology Photoperiod is calculated from day of year and latitude using standard astronomical equations accounting for civil twilight using the parameter twilight, which is assumed to be -6\\(^{\\circ}\\) (civil twilight) in wheat.xml. Twilight is defined as the interval between sunrise or sunset and the time when the true center of the sun is 6\\(^{\\circ}\\) below the horizon. Other crop modules of APSIM have used -2.2\\(^{\\circ}\\) as twilight parameters. In APSIM, the photoperiod affects phenology between emergence and floral initiation (Fig. 3.1). During this period, thermal time is affected by a photoperiod factor (\\(f_{D}\\) in Equation (3.4) and Equation (3.5)) that is calculated by \\[\\begin{equation} f_{D}=1-0.002R_{p}(20-L_{P})^{2} \\tag{3.7} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(L_{P}\\) is the day length (h), \\(R_{P}\\) is the sensitivities to photoperiod which is cultivar-specific and is specified by photop_sens in wheat.xml. The default value of \\(R_{P}\\) is 3 (Fig. 3.4). Figure 3.4: Relationship between photoperiod factor (\\(f_{D}\\)) and day length (\\(L_{P}\\)) with different sensitivities to photoperiod (\\(R_{p}\\)). The default value of \\(R_{P}\\) is 3. 3.5 Vernalisation impact on phenology In APSIM, vernalisation effects phenology between emergence and floral initiation (Fig. 3.1). During this period, thermal time is affected by a vernalisation factor (\\(f_{V}\\) in Equation (3.4) and Equation (3.5)). Vernalisation is simulated from daily average crown temperature (\\(T_{c}\\)), daily maximum (\\(T_{max}\\)) and minimum (\\(T_{min}\\)) temperatures using the original CERES approach (Fig. 3.5). \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta V=\\min(1.4-0.0778T_{c},\\:0.5+13.44\\frac{T_{c}}{(T_{max}-T_{min}+3)^{2}})\\quad\\text{when, }T_{max}&lt;30\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\:\\text{and}\\,T_{min}&lt;15\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C} \\end{equation}\\] Figure 3.5: Relationship between vernalisation (\\(\\Delta V\\)) and maximum (\\(T_{max}\\)) and minimum (\\(T_{min}\\)) temperature. Devernalisation can occur if daily \\(T_{max}\\) is above 30 \\(^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\) and the total vernalisation (\\(V\\)) is less than 10 (Fig. 3.6). \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta V_{d}=\\min(0.5(T_{max}-30),\\:V)\\quad\\text{when, }T_{max}&gt;30\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\;\\text{and}\\;V&lt;10 \\end{equation}\\] Figure 3.6: Relationship between devernalisation (\\(\\Delta V_{d}\\)) and maximum temperature (\\(T_{max}\\)) when the total vernalisation (\\(V\\)) is less than 10. The total vernalisation (\\(V\\)) is calculated by summing daily vernalisation and devernalisation from Germination to Floral initiation (Composite phase Vernalisation in Fig. 3.1). \\[\\begin{equation} V=\\sum(\\Delta V-\\Delta V_{d}) \\end{equation}\\] However, the vernalisation factor (\\(f_{v}\\)) is calculated just from Emergence to Floral initiation (Composite phases in Fig. ). \\[\\begin{equation} f_{V}=1-(0.0054545R_{V}+0.0003)\\times(50-V) \\tag{3.8} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(R_{V}\\) is the sensitivities to vernalisation, which is cultivar-specific and is specified by vern_sens in wheat.xml. The default value of \\(R_{V}\\) is 1.5 (Fig. 3.7) Figure 3.7: Relationship between cumulated vernalisation (\\(V\\)) and vernalisation factor (\\(f_{V}\\)) and for different sensitivities to vernalisation (\\(R_{V}\\)). The default value of \\(R_{V}\\) is 1.5.

This water-limited biomass (\\(\\Delta Q_{w}\\)) is a function of the ratio between the daily water uptake (\\(W_{u}\\), Equation (11.6)) and demand (\\(W_{d}\\), Equation (4.12)) capped by \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta Q_{w}=\\Delta Q_{r}f_{w,\\,photo}=\\Delta Q_{r}\\frac{W_{u}}{W_{d}} \\tag{4.11} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(f_{w,\\,photo}\\) is the water stress factor affecting photosynthesis (Equation (11.8)); \\(W_{u}\\) is the actual daily water uptake from the root system (which corresponds to the soil water supply (\\(W_{s}\\)) capped by \\(W_{d}\\)), \\(W_{d}\\) is the soil water demand of Leaf and Head parts (). When the soil water is non-limiting (\\(f_{w,\\,photo}\\) = 1, i.e. \\(W_{d}\\geq W_{s}\\)), biomass accumulation is limited by the radiation (\\(\\Delta Q=\\Delta Q_{r}\\), Equation (4.13)). When the soil water is limiting, biomass accumulation is limited by water supply (\\(\\Delta Q=\\Delta Q_{w}\\)). The water demand (\\(W_{d}\\), in mm) corresponds to the amount of water the crop would have transpired in the absence of soil water constraint, and is calculated from the potential biomass accumulation from RUE (\\(\\Delta Q_{r}\\), Equation (4.1)). Following , transpiration demand is modeled as a function of the current day’s crop growth rate, estimated by the potential biomass accumulation associated with intercepted radiation (\\(\\Delta Q_{r}\\), see Equation (4.1)), divided by the transpiration efficiency. \\[\\begin{equation} W_{d}=\\frac{\\Delta Q_{r}-R}{TE} \\tag{4.12} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(R\\) is respiration rate and equals to zero in the current version of APSIM-Wheat, \\(TE\\) is transpiration efficiency (Equation (11.2)). See for more details about water demand and supply. The daily biomass accumulation (\\(\\Delta Q\\)) corresponds to dry matter above ground biomass is limited by the radiation interception (\\(\\Delta Q_{r}\\), Equation (4.1)) or by soil water deficiency (\\(\\Delta Q_{w}\\), Equation (11.9)), so that daily biomass accumulation can be expressed as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta Q=\\begin{cases} \\Delta Q_{r}\\qquad &amp; W_{u}=W_{d}\\\\ \\Delta Q_{w}\\qquad &amp; W_{u}&lt;W_{d} \\end{cases} \\tag{4.13} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(W_{s}\\) is water supply, \\(W_{d}\\) is the soil water demand from the shoot, limited by radiation interception ( Section (???)(Crop-water-demand)). In the current APSIM-Wheat, \\(W_{d}\\) is actually only directly affected by the soil water demand of the leaf ( Section (???)(Crop-water-demand)). \\(W_{u}\\) and \\(W_{d}\\) are calculated by soil module of APSIM.

Leaf includes only leaf blades. Stem is defined in a functional rather than a morphological manner and includes plant stems, leaf sheaths and stem-like petioles (not applicable for wheat). Head is divided into Grain and Pod (which correspond to spike without the grain). Then grain are separated into Meal and Oil (not used). The structure of wheat parts is shown in Fig. 5.1. Figure 5.1: The hierarchical structure of wheat parts. Texts in the parentheses are classes of parts. The gray box indicates a plant part not used in wheat. On the day of emergence, biomass in plant parts (Root, Head, Leaf, Stem, Pod, Meal and Oil) are initialized by root_dm_init (set at 0.01 g plant in the wheat.xml file), leaf_dm_init (0.003 g plant), stem_dm_init (0.0016 g plant), pod_dm_init (0 g plant), meal_dm_init (0 g plant), oil_dm_init (0 g plant), respectively. Daily biomass production (Equation (4.13)) is then partitioned to different plant parts in different ratios that vary with crop stage. Overall, Root biomass are calculated with a shoot:root ratio from the above-ground biomass (\\(\\Delta Q\\); Fig. 5.2). Then the above-ground biomass are partitioned into the different plant parts hierarchically, with biomass being attributed first to Head, then Leaf and finally Stem. This means that all parts might not have the biomass demand satisfied if the biomass production is limited. Figure 5.2: Biomass partition rules in the APSIM-Wheat module. Texts in the parentheses are partitioning methods of different organ types. The above-ground biomass is used to calculate Root biomass based on a shoot:root ratio, and is then partition to (1) Head based on the demand from Pod and Grain, and then (2) Leaf (proportion of the remaining biomass), and (3) Stem. Re-translocation occurs during grain filling, when the biomass accumulation doesn’t satisfy Head demand. Biomass from Stem and Pod are then used to satisfy the Head demand (Pod and Grain). 5.2 Biomass partitioning to Root Firstly, some biomass are allocated to the root as a ratio of daily available biomass (\\(\\Delta Q\\), Equation (4.1)). The so-called ‘magic’ fraction of biomass going to Root is calculated from a stage-dependent function, but is independent on pedo-climatic factors (Fig. 5.3). All biomass in the Root is considered as structural fraction, meaning that it cannot be re-translocated to other parts later on. \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta Q_{root}=\\Delta Q\\times R_{Root:Shoot} \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\Delta Q_{root}\\) is the daily increment in Root biomass; and \\(R_{Root:Shoot}\\) is the ratio root:shoot biomass, which is defined by x_stax_stage_no_partition and y_ratio_root_shoot in wheat.xml (Fig. 5.3). which is specified in wheat.xml ) Figure 5.3: Relationship between ratio of root and shoot and growth stage. 5.3 Biomass partitioning to Head (Pod, \\texttt{Meal and (not applicable in this version))} Then all or part of available biomass (\\(\\Delta Q\\)) are partitioned into Heads according to total demand of Heads (Meal, Oil and Pod). Meal and Pod demands are calculated by Equation (6.1) and Equation (6.2). Oil demand always equals to zero in the current version of the APSIM-Wheat module. Biomass directly partitioned in Pod or Grain is considered as structural and cannot be re-translocated, however the biomass providing from re-translocation is accumulated as non-structural biomass. The Pod non-structural biomass can then be re-translocated into Grain (See Section (???)(Re-translocation)). \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{c} \\Delta Q_{head}=\\min(\\Delta Q,\\,D_{grain}+D_{pod})\\\\ \\Delta Q_{grain}=\\frac{D_{g}}{D_{head}}\\Delta A_{head}\\\\ \\Delta Q_{pod}=\\frac{D_{p}}{D_{head}}\\Delta A_{head} \\end{array} \\tag{5.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\Delta Q_{head}\\) is the daily available biomass for Head, \\(D_{head}\\), \\(D_{grain}\\)and \\(D_{pod}\\) are demands for Head, Grain and Pod, respectively (see and Section (???)(Pod-demand)). \\(\\Delta Q_{grain}\\) and \\(\\Delta Q_{pod}\\) are biomass increment of Grain and Pod, respectively. 5.4 Biomass partitioning to Leaf Then, the remaining biomass (after the partitioning to the Heads) are partitioned into Leaf based on a stage dependent function (Fig. 5.4).

Until the stage start of grain filling, 65% of this biomass is distributed to structural biomass (Fig. 5.5), while remaining 35% is allocated in un-structural biomass. Afterwards, all new biomass allocated to Stem is for non-structural biomass (which can re-mobilised). \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta Q_{stem}=\\Delta Q-\\Delta Q_{head}-\\Delta Q_{leaf} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta Q_{stem.\\,structural}=\\Delta Q_{stem}\\times h_{structual} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta Q_{stem.\\,non-structural}=\\Delta Q_{stem}\\times(1-h_{structual}) \\tag{5.3} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\Delta Q_{stem}\\) is the daily increment in Stem biomass; \\(\\Delta Q_{stem.\\,structural}\\) is the structural biomass of Stem; \\(\\Delta Q_{stem.\\,non-structural}\\) is the non-structural biomass of Stem; and \\(h_{structual}\\) is the fraction of Stem biomass distributed to structural biomass which depends on the growth stage (S). \\(h_{structual}\\) is specified by stemGrowthStructuralFraction and stemGrowthStructuralFractionStage in wheat.xml, with a default value of 0.65 before beginning of grain filling and 0 after. Figure 5.5: Relationship between fraction of structural and unstructural biomass in Stem. 5.6 Re-translocation If the supply in assimilate (daily biomass increase) is insufficient to meet Grain demand, then re-translocation may occur to meet the shortfall (Fig. 5.2). The biomass re-translocation first occurs from the Stem non-structural biomass. From the start of grain filling, the wheat module allows a total re-translocation of up to 20% of Stem biomass per day. If required, biomass can then be re-translocated from the Pod non-structural biomass.

The maximum of these causes is the day’s total leaf area index senescence. \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{\\ensuremath{\\Delta}LAI}_{sen}=\\max(\\text{\\ensuremath{\\Delta}LAI}_{sen,\\,age},\\;\\text{\\ensuremath{\\Delta}LAI}_{sen,\\,sw},\\;\\Delta\\text{LAI}_{sen,\\,light},\\;\\text{\\ensuremath{\\Delta}LAI}_{sen,\\,frost},\\;\\text{\\ensuremath{\\Delta}LAI}_{sen,\\,heat}) \\end{equation}\\] Leaf area senescence caused by age corresponds to the leaf area of the number of leaves senesced (\\(\\Delta N_{d,\\,sen}\\)) from the lowest leaf position. Leaf area senescence caused by soil water (\\(\\text{\\ensuremath{\\Delta}LAI}_{sen,\\,sw}\\)) is calculated as follows. \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{\\ensuremath{\\Delta}LAI}_{sen,\\,sw}=k_{sen,\\,sw}\\times(1-f_{sw,\\,photo})\\times\\text{LAI} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(k_{sen,\\,sw}\\) is the slope of the linear equation relating to soil water stress to leaf senescence rate and is specified by sen_rate_water in wheat.xml (default value 0.10); \\(f_{sw,\\,photo}\\) is soil water stress for photosynthesis (Equation (11.8)); LAI is the leaf area index. Leaf area senescence caused by light intensity (\\(\\text{\\ensuremath{\\Delta}LAI}_{sen,\\,light}\\)) is calculated as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{\\ensuremath{\\Delta}LAI}_{sen,\\,light}=k_{sen,\\,light}\\times(\\text{LAI}-\\text{LAI}_{c,\\,light})\\times\\text{LAI}\\quad\\text{LAI}&gt;\\text{LAI}_{c,\\,light} \\tag{10.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(k_{sen,\\,light}\\) is sensitivity of leaf area senescence to shading and is specified by sen_light_slope in wheat.xml (default value 0.002); \\(\\text{LAI}_{c,\\,light}\\) is the critical LAI when shading is starting to cause leaf area senescence and is specified by lai_sen_light in wheat.xml (default value 7).

Figure 10.1: Fraction of senescence of leaf area index (\\(k_{sen,\\,heat}\\)) in response to maximum temperature. The total leaf area of plant must be more than the minimum plant area (min_tpla), which has default value 5 mm\\(^{\\text{2}}\\) plant\\(^{\\text{-1}}\\). When some leaves are senesced, only a small amount of nitrogen is retained in the senesced leaf, the rest is made available for re-translocation included into the Stem N pool ( Section (???)(NitrogenPartitioningAndRetranslocation)). The concentration of nitrogen in senesced material is specified in wheat.xml. 10.3 Biomass senescence Leaf biomass senescence \\(\\Delta Q_{sl}\\) is the ratio of leaf area senescence (\\(\\text{\\ensuremath{\\Delta}LAI}_{sen}\\)) with total the green LAI at the time considered (LAI). \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta Q_{sl}=\\Delta Q_{l}\\frac{\\text{\\ensuremath{\\text{\\ensuremath{\\Delta}LAI}_{sen}}}}{\\text{LAI}} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\Delta Q_{l}\\) is the daily increase of leaf biomass. 10.4 Root senescence A rate of 0.5% of root biomass and root length is senesced each day and detaches immediately being sent to the soil nitrogen module and distributed as fresh organic matter in the profile. \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta Q_{sen,\\,root}=\\Delta Q_{root}\\times f_{sen,\\,root} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\Delta Q_{sen,\\,root}\\) is the daily Root senesced biomass, and \\(f_{sen,\\,root}\\) is the fraction of senesced root biomass, which is defined in x_dm_sen_frac_root and y_dm_sen_frac_root in wheat.xml (Fig. 10.2) Figure 10.2: Fraction of senescence of root biomass. \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta L_{sen,\\,root}=\\Delta Q_{sen,\\,root}\\times\\text{SRL} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\Delta L_{sen,\\,root}\\) is the daily root length senescence, and SRL is the specific root length. Root senescence occurs in each of the soil layers where roots are present, as a proportion of the total root length. \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta L_{sen,\\,root}(i)=\\Delta L_{sen,\\,root}\\times\\frac{L_{r}(i)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{i}L_{r}(j)} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(L_{sen,\\,root}(i)\\) is the root length senescence in soil layer \\(i\\), \\(L_{r}(i)\\) is root length in layer \\(i\\), and \\(\\sum_{j=1}^{i}L_{r}(j)\\)is the total root length for all the layers where root are present.

The saturated vapour pressure is calculated at both the maximum and minimum temperatures, and the default vapour pressure deficit for the day is taken as 75% (\\(f_{v}\\), defined by svp_fract in wheat.xml) of the difference between these two vapour pressures. Crop water demand is capped to below a given multiple of potential ET (taken as Priestly-Taylor Eo from the water balance module) as specified by \\hyperlink{eo_crop_factor_default}{eo_crop_factor_default} in the wheat.xml file (default value 1.5). This limits water use to reasonable values on days with high VPD or in more arid environments. 11.2 Potential and actual extractable soil water Potential and actual extractable soil water is the sum of root water contents available to the crop from each profile layer occupied by roots. If roots are only partially through a layer available soil water is scaled to the portion that contains roots. Potential extractable soil water (\\(\\text{ESW}_{p}\\)) is the difference between drained upper limit soil water content (DUL) and lower limit of plant-extractable soil water (LL) for each soil layer. The actual extractable soil water (\\(esw_{a}\\)) is the difference between the soil water content (SW) and lower limit of plant-extractable soil water (LL) for each soil layer. \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{c} \\text{ESW}_{p}(i)=\\text{DUL}(i)-\\text{LL}(i)\\\\ \\text{ESW}a(i)=\\text{SW}(i)-\\text{LL}(i)\\\\ \\text{ESW}_{p}=\\sum_{i=1}^{I}[\\text{DUL}(i)-\\text{LL}(i)]\\\\ \\text{ESW}_{a}=\\sum_{i=1}^{I}[\\text{SW}(i)-\\text{LL}(i)] \\end{array} \\tag{11.4} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(i\\) indicates soil layers (where roots are present), and \\(I\\) indicates the deepest soil water of root presented. Similar variables are calculated for the entire soil profile (i.e. roots may not occupy all the layers). \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{c} \\text{PAWC}=\\sum_{i}^{N_{s}}[\\text{DUL}(i)-\\text{LL}(i)]\\\\ \\text{ESW}=\\sum_{i}^{N_{s}}[\\text{SW}(i)-\\text{LL}(i)] \\end{array} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(i\\) indicates soil layers, \\(N_{s}\\) indicates the number of soil layers, and PAWC is the plant available water capacity. 11.3 Crop water supply, i.e. potential soil water uptake The APSIM-Wheat module can be coupled to either the SWIM2 module (see module documentation) or the SOILWAT2 module (default). When the APSIM-Wheat module is coupled to APSIM-SOILWAT2, potential soil water uptake (or water supply, \\(W_{s}\\)) is calculated using the approach first advocated by Monteith (1986). Crop water supply is considered as the sum of potential root water uptake from each profile layer occupied by root. If roots are only partially through a layer available soil water is scaled to the portion that contains roots. The potential rate of extraction in a layer is calculated using a rate constant (KL) as actual extractable soil water. The KL defines the fraction of available water able to be extracted per day. The KL factor is empirically derived, incorporating both plant and soil factors which limit rate of water uptake. Root water extraction values (KL) must be defined for each combination of crop species and soil type. \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{c} \\begin{array}{cc} W_{s}(i) &amp; =\\text{KL}(i)[\\text{SW}(i)-\\text{LL}(i)]\\qquad\\qquad if\\,i\\leq I-1\\\\ &amp; =\\frac{D_{r}(i)}{D_{s}(i)}\\text{KL}(i)[\\text{SW}(i)-\\text{LL}(i)]\\qquad\\qquad if\\,i=I \\end{array}\\\\ W_{s}=\\sum_{i=1}^{I}W_{s}(i) \\end{array} \\tag{11.5} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(i\\) is the soil layer, \\(I\\) is the deepest soil layer where roots are present, \\(W_{s}(i)\\) is the water supply available from layer \\(i\\), \\(W_{s}\\) is the crop water supply, \\(\\text{SW}(i)\\) is the soil water content in layer \\(i\\), \\(\\text{LL}(i)\\) is the lower limit of plant-extractable soil water in layer \\(i\\), \\(\\text{KL}(i)\\) is the root water extraction values in layer \\(i\\), \\(D_{r}(i)\\) is the root depth within the soil layer (\\(i\\)) where roots are present, and \\(D_{s}(i)\\) is the thickness of this layer \\(i\\). 11.4 Actual soil water uptake The actual rate of water uptake is the lesser of the potential soil water supply (\\(W_{s}\\), Equation (11.5)) and the soil water demand (\\(W_{d}\\), Equation (11.1)), which is determining whether biomass production is limited by radiation or water uptake (Equation (4.13)) \\[\\begin{equation} W_{u}=\\min(W_{d},\\,W_{s}) \\tag{11.6} \\end{equation}\\] If the potential soil water supply (accessible by the roots) exceeds the crop water demand, then the actual soil water uptake (\\(W_{u}\\)) is removed from the occupied layers in proportion to the values of potential root water uptake in each layer. If the computed soil water supply from the profile is less than the demand then, and the actual root water uptake from a layer is equal to the computed potential uptake. If there are not soil water supply and demand, soil water update equals to zero. \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{c} \\Delta W_{s}(i)=-W_{s}(i)\\times\\frac{W_{d}}{W_{s}}\\qquad if\\;W_{s}&lt;W_{d}\\\\ \\Delta W_{s}(i)=-W_{s}(i)\\qquad if\\;W_{s}&gt;W_{d}\\\\ \\Delta W_{s}(i)=0\\qquad if\\;W_{s}=W_{d}=0 \\end{array} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\Delta W_{s}(i)\\) is the daily change in soil water content at layer \\(i\\) (where roots are present), and \\(W_{s}(i)\\) is the water supply available from layer \\(i\\) (Equation (11.5)) . 11.5 Soil water stresses affecting plant growth Soil water deficit factors are calculated to simulate the effects of water stress on different plant growth-and-development processes. Three water deficit factors are calculated which correspond to four plant processes, each having different sensitivity to water stress i.e. photosynthesis, leaf expansion, and phenology. Each of these factors is capped between 0 and 1, where the value of 0 corresponds to a complete stress, while 1 corresponds to no stress. Leaf expansion is considered more sensitive to stress than photosynthesis, while soil water has no impact on crop phenology in the current APSIM-Wheat version. 11.5.1 Phenology Soil water stress of phenology is determined by the soil water deficiency. \\[\\begin{equation} f_{W,\\,pheno}=h_{w,\\,pheno}(\\frac{esw_{a}}{esw_{p}}) \\tag{11.7} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(esw_{a}\\) is the actual extractable soil water in root layers, \\(esw_{p}\\) is the potential extractable soil water in root layers. \\(h_{w,\\,pheno}\\) is a function of soil water available ratio and soil water stress, which is defined by parameters x_sw_avail_ratio and y_swdef_pheno (default value 1) in wheat.xml and linearly interpolated by APSIM. In the current version of APSIM-Wheat module, no soil water stress for phenology is applied (Fig. 11.3). The soil water stress of phenology for flowering (x_sw_avail_ratio_flowering and y_swdef_pheno_flowering) and grain filling (x_sw_avail_ratio_start_grain_fill and y_swdef_pheno_start_grain_fill) phases are calculated in the source code, but don’t have influence on the phenology of wheat in the current APSIM-Wheat version (default value of 1). Figure 11.3: Relationship between soil water stress factor affecting phenology (\\(f_{W,\\, pheno}\\)) and the ratio of available soil water (\\(\\frac{esw_{a}}{esw_{p}}\\)). 11.5.2 Photosynthesis Soil water stress of biomass accumulation (\\(f_{w,\\,photo}\\)) is calculated as follows. \\[\\begin{equation} f_{w,\\,photo}=\\frac{W_{u}}{W_{d}} \\tag{11.8} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(W_{u}\\) is the total daily water uptake from root system (Equation (11.6)), \\(W_{d}\\) is the soil water demand of Leaf and Head parts (Equation (11.1)). Finally, the potential biomass production (radiation-limited\\(\\Delta Q\\)) can limit by water uptake (\\(f_{w,\\,photo}&lt;1\\), i.e. when \\(W_{u}&lt;W_{d}\\)), or not (when \\(f_{w,\\,photo}=1\\), i.e. when \\(W_{u}=W_{d}\\)) \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta Q_{w}=\\Delta Q_{r}f_{w,\\,photo}=\\Delta Q_{r}\\frac{W_{u}}{W_{d}} \\tag{11.9} \\end{equation}\\] \\(f_{w,photo}\\) also affect the senescence of the leaves. 11.5.3 Leaf expansion Soil water stress of leaf expansion is determined by the deficit of soil water. \\[\\begin{equation} f_{W,\\,expan}=h_{w,\\,expan}(\\frac{W_{u}}{W_{d}}) \\tag{11.10} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(W_{u}\\) is the crop water uptake (Equation (11.6)), \\(W_{d}\\) is the crop water demand (Equation (11.1)). \\(h_{w,\\,expan}\\) is a function of soil water content and stress, and is defined by parameters x_sw_demand_ratio and y_swdef_leaf in the wheat.xml, which is linearly interpolated by APSIM (Fig. 11.4). Figure 11.4: Relationship between the soil water stress factor affecting expansion (\\(f_{W,\\, expan}\\)) and supply:demand ratio (\\(\\frac{W_{e}}{W_{d}}\\)). 11.6 KL factor APSIM 7.5 introduces a modifying factor on KL (rate of maximum daily water uptake per day) where there is an excess of chloride concentration (Cl), exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), or electrical conductivity (EC) properties in the soil . The KL modifier is optional and triggered by setting the ModifyKL parameter to yes. When the KL modifier is activated, KL values are modified for each layer, by factors (concerning Cl, ESP, EC; Fig. 11.5) applied to default KL values. The modifiers are calculated using one of the limiting factors in order of preference (Cl, ESP, EC), i.e. KL is modified only if there are no soil parameters for Cl. The parameters in the wheat.xml that control this mechanism are ClA, CLB, ESPA, ESPB, ECA, ECB (slope and intercept of linear relationship for Cl, ESP and EC).

Wheat has a defined minimum (\\(C_{N,\\,min}\\)), critical (\\(C_{N,\\,crit}\\)) and maximum (\\(C_{N,\\,max}\\)) nitrogen concentration for all plant parts (Fig. 12.1). These concentration limits change with phenological stages (Fig. 12.1).

Figure 12.2: Relationship between nitrogen demand of Grain and daily mean temperature. 12.2.2 Nitrogen demand of other parts Demand of nitrogen in each part (except Grain) attempts to maintain nitrogen at the critical (non-stressed) level. Nitrogen demand on any day is the sum of the demands from the pre-existing biomass of each part required to reach critical nitrogen content, plus the nitrogen required to maintain critical nitrogen concentrations in that day’s produced biomass. For each plant part (Leaf, Stem, and Pod) the nitrogen demand is given by: \\[\\begin{equation} N_{D,\\;crit}=\\frac{\\Delta Q_{part}C_{N,\\,crit}}{f_{w,\\,photo}}+f_{n}(C_{N,\\,crit}-C_{N,\\,part})\\qquad if\\:C_{N,\\,crit}&gt;C_{N,\\,part}\\;\\&amp;\\;Q_{part}&gt;0 \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} N_{D,\\;max}=\\frac{\\Delta Q_{part}C_{N,\\,max}}{f_{w,\\,photo}}+f_{n}(C_{N,\\,max}-C_{N,\\,part})\\qquad if\\:C_{N,\\,max}&gt;C_{N,\\,part}\\;\\&amp;\\;Q_{part}&gt;0 \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\Delta Q_{part}\\) is the growth dry weight of parts, \\(Q_{part}\\) is the green (i.e. not senesced) dry weight of parts, \\(f_{w,\\,photo}\\) is soil water stress of biomass accumulation (Equation (11.8)); \\(C_{N,\\,part}\\) is the nitrogen concentration of parts; \\(f_{n}\\) is defined by parameter n_deficit_uptake_fraction in wheat.xml with default value 0.0001. \\(C_{N,\\,crit}\\) and \\(C_{N,\\,max}\\) are the N concentration critic and maximal of the parts, respectively (Fig. 12.1). \\(N_{D,\\;crit}\\) and \\(N_{D,\\;max}\\) equal to 0, if \\(Q_{part}=0\\). 12.3 Nitrogen uptake, partitioning and re-translocation 12.3.1 Nitrogen concentrations in wheat parts The N concentration in Leaf is calculated as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} C_{N,\\,leaf}=N_{leaf}/Q_{leaf} \\end{equation}\\] 12.3.2 Nitrogen uptake Daily total nitrogen uptake (\\(N_{u}\\)) is the lesser of N demand (\\(N_{d}\\), Equation (12.2)) and N supply \\(N_{s}\\), Equation (12.1)). \\[\\begin{equation} N_{u}=\\text{min}(N_{d},\\;N_{s}) \\end{equation}\\] 12.3.3 Nitrogen translocation Daily total nitrogen uptake is distributed to the plant parts in proportion to their individual demands. 12.3.4 Nitrogen re-translocation If there is insufficient nitrogen supplied from senescing material and soil nitrogen uptake, Grain nitrogen demand is met by re-translocating nitrogen from other plant parts. Nitrogen is available for re-translocation from un-senesced leaves and stems until they reach their defined minimum nitrogen concentration.

The nitrogen stress on phenology is used in the calculation of the adjusted thermal time (Equation (3.4)). However, In the current version of APSIM-Wheat module, the default parameters are applied for no nitrogen water stress for phenology. 12.4.2 Biomass accumulation Nitrogen stress on biomass accumulation (via \\(f_{N,\\,photo}\\) in Equation (4.5)) is determined by the difference between leaf nitrogen concentration and leaf minimum and critical nitrogen concentration. \\[\\begin{equation} f_{N,\\,photo}=h_{N,\\,photo}\\sum_{leaf}\\frac{C_{N}-C_{N,\\,min}}{C_{N,\\,crit}\\times f_{c,\\,N}-C_{N,\\,min}} \\tag{12.4} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(C_{N}\\) is the nitrogen concentration of Leaf parts; \\(h_{N,\\,photo}\\) is multiplier for nitrogen deficit effect on photosynthesis which is specified by N_fact_photo in the wheat.xml and default value is 1.5; \\(C_{N,\\,crit}\\) and \\(C_{N,\\,min}\\) are the N concentration critic and minimal of the parts, respectively (Fig. 12.1); and \\(f_{c,\\,N}\\) is a factor with a value of 1 (i.e. no impact) for Stem, and is depending on CO for Leaf (Fig. 6.2). The nitrogen stress on biomass accumulation affects the radiation-limited biomass accumulation (\\(\\Delta Q_{r}\\), Equation (4.13)). 12.4.3 Leaf appearance and expansion (i.e. leaf number and LAI) Nitrogen stress on leaf appearance and expansion (via \\(f_{N,\\,expan}\\) in Equation (7.4)) is determined by the difference between leaf nitrogen concentration and leaf minimum and critical nitrogen concentration. \\[\\begin{equation} f_{N,\\,expan}=h_{N,\\,expan}\\sum_{leaf}\\frac{C_{N}-C_{N,\\,min}}{C_{N,\\,crit}\\times f_{c,\\,N}-C_{N,\\,min}} \\tag{12.5} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(C_{N}\\) is the nitrogen concentration of Leaf parts; \\(h_{N,\\,expan}\\) is multiplier for nitrogen deficit effect on expansion which is specified by N_fact_expansion in the wheat.xml (default value 1); \\(C_{N,\\,crit}\\) and \\(C_{N,\\,min}\\) are the N concentration critic and minimal of the parts, respectively (Fig. 12.1); and \\(f_{c,\\,N}\\) is a factor with a value of 1 (i.e. no impact) for Stem, and is depending on CO for Leaf (Fig. 6.2). The nitrogen stress on leaf appearance and expansion affects the potential leaf number (\\(N_{d,\\,pot}\\); Equation (7.3)) and the stressed leaf area index (\\(\\Delta\\text{LAI}_{d,\\,s}\\), Equation (8.1)). 12.4.4 Grain filling (biomass and nitrogen demand of grain) Nitrogen stress on grain filling affects the biomass demand of Grain (via \\(f_{N,\\,grain}\\) in Equation (6.1)) and the N demand of Grain (Equation (12.2)). The nitrogen factor \\(f_{N,\\,grain}\\) (that impacts N demand of grain) is determined by the difference between organ nitrogen concentration and organ minimum and critical nitrogen concentration as follows:. \\[\\begin{equation} f_{N,\\,grain}=\\frac{h_{N,\\ poten}}{h_{N,\\ min}}h_{N,\\,grain}\\sum_{stem,\\,leaf}\\frac{C_{N}-C_{N,\\,min}}{C_{N,\\,crit}\\times f_{c,\\,N}-C_{N,\\,min}}\\qquad(0\\leq f_{N,\\,fill}\\leq1) \\tag{12.6} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(h_{N,\\ poten}\\) is the potential rate of grain filling which is specified by potential_grain_n_filling_rate in wheat.xml and has a default value of 0.000055 g grain d; \\(h_{N,\\ min}\\) is the minimum rate of grain filling which is specified by minimum_grain_n_filling_rate in wheat.xml and has a default value of 0.000015 g grain d; \\(h_{N,\\,grain}\\) is a multiplier for nitrogen deficit effect on grain, which is specified by n_fact_grain in wheat.xml and has a default value of 1; \\(C_{N}\\) is the nitrogen concentration of Stem or Leaf parts; \\(C_{N,\\,crit}\\) and \\(C_{N,\\,min}\\) are critical and minimum nitrogen concentration, respectively, for Stem and Leaf parts. \\(C_{N,\\,crit}\\) and \\(C_{N,\\,min}\\) are functions of growth stage and nitrogen concentration which is defined by parameters x_stage_code, y_n_conc_min_leaf, y_n_conc_crit_leaf, y_n_conc_min_stem, y_n_conc_crit_stem in wheat.xml and linearly interpolated by APSIM (Fig. 12.1); and \\(f_{c,\\,N}\\) is a factor with a value of 1 (i.e. no impact) for Stem, and is depending on CO for Leaf (Fig. 6.2).
